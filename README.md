### Notes on the code
The .R files contain the code to build the data files and some summary figures.  In line comments mention some key gaps.

Viral Surveillance — Data collection from both the U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories began during the 1997-98 season. The volume of tested specimens has greatly increased during this time due to increased participation and increased testing. During the 1997-98 season 43 state public health laboratories participated in surveillance, and by the 2004-05 season all state public health laboratories were participating in surveillance. The addition of NREVSS data during the 1997-98 season roughly doubled the amount of virologic data reported each week.

The number of specimens tested and % positive rate vary by region and season based on different testing practices including triaging of specimens by the reporting labs, therefore it is not appropriate to compare the magnitude of positivity rates or the number of positive specimens between regions or seasons.

The U.S. WHO and NREVSS collaborating laboratories report the total number of respiratory specimens tested and the number positive for influenza types A and B each week to CDC. Most of the U.S. WHO collaborating laboratories also report the influenza A subtype (H1 or H3) of the viruses they have isolated, but the majority of NREVSS laboratories do not report the influenza A subtype.

Outpatient Illness Surveillance — Information on patient visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). This collaborative effort between CDC, state and local health departments, and health care providers started during the 1997-98 influenza season when approximately 250 providers were enrolled. Enrollment in the system has increased over time and there were >3,000 providers enrolled during the 2010-11 season.

The number and percent of patients presenting with ILI each week will vary by region and season due to many factors, including having different provider type mixes (children present with higher rates of ILI than adults, and therefore regions with a higher percentage of pediatric practices will have higher numbers of cases). Therefore it is not appropriate to compare the magnitude of the percent of visits due to ILI between regions and seasons.

Baseline levels are calculated both nationally and for each region. Percentages at or above the baseline level are considered to be elevated.
